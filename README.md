# Portfolio
This is the code source for my personal website hosted at <a href="https://cs.rit.edu/~drs3114/"> RIT CS machine</a>.
This project makes extensive use of Twitter bootstrap framework and uses fonts from fontawesome and google fonts.

###Update
This project will shortly go unmaintained and the newer version of this project `Portfolio 2.0` will be replacing with Angular 4 and Material UI support.
